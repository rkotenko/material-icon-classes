Using ligatures is great.  And google icons is a pretty <a href="https://www.google.com/design/icons/">big collection</a>

This css file allows ligatures to be used as classes as well as the standard way for more flexibility.  For instance, you may find it easier to change a class than have to switch the text of an element.

Standard

    <i class="material-icons">book</i>
    

With css file
   
    <i class="material-icons icon-book"></i>

Of course, you will need to include the @font-face and material-icons class. Create a stylesheet link to this: https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons
